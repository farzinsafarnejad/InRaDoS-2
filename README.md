# InRaDoS-2
InRaDoS 2 is a free computer program to calculate the absorbed and effective dose for radiopharmaceuticals.
Programming Language: The Program was developed using the Python programming language, and its GUI was developed using the tkinter module.
Calculation method: The MIRD method was used for absorbed dose calculation. This method allows one to calculate the absorbed doses to the target organs due to the presence of radioactive material in the source organ(s).
Biokinetic data: The biokinetic data of radiopharmaceuticals were taken from ICRP Publications 53 and 128. The biokinetic data for new radiopharmaceuticals, such as F-18 Alfatide II, were taken from recently published papers.
